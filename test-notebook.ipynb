      "\n",
      "Mary Wollstonecraft was born on the 27th of April, 1759. Her father--a\n",
      "quick-tempered and unsettled man, capable of beating wife, or child, or\n",
      "dog--was the son of a manufacturer who made money in Spitalfields, when\n",
      "Spitalfields was prosperous. Her mother was a rigorous Irishwoman, of\n",
      "the Dixons of Ballyshannon. Edward John Wollstonecraft--of whose\n",
      "children, besides Mary, the second child, three sons and two daughters\n",
      "lived to be men and women--in course of time got rid of about ten\n",
      "thousand pounds, which had been left him by his father. He began to get\n",
      "rid of it by farming. Mary Wollstonecraft's first-remembered home was in\n",
      "a farm at Epping. When she was five years old the family moved to\n",
      "another farm, by the Chelmsford Road. When she was between six and seven\n",
      "years old they moved again, to the neighbourhood of Barking. There they\n",
      "remained three years before the next move, which was to a farm near\n",
      "Beverley, in Yorkshire. In Yorkshire they remained six years, and Mary\n",
      "Wollstonecraft had there what education fell to her lot between the ages\n",
      "of ten and sixteen. Edward John Wollstonecraft then gave up farming to\n",
      "venture upon a commercial speculation. This caused him to live for a\n",
      "year and a half at Queen's Row, Hoxton. His daughter Mary was then\n",
      "sixteen; and while at Hoxton she had her education advanced by the\n",
      "friendly care of a deformed clergyman--a Mr. Clare--who lived next door,\n",
      "and stayed so much at home that his one pair of shoes had lasted him for\n",
      "fourteen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mary Wollstonecraft's chief friend at this time was an accomplished\n",
      "girl only two years older than herself, who maintained her father,\n",
      "mother, and family by skill in drawing. Her name was Frances Blood, and\n",
      "she especially, by her example and direct instruction, drew out her\n",
      "young friend's powers. In 1776, Mary Wollstonecraft's father, a rolling\n",
      "stone, rolled into Wales. Again he was a farmer. Next year again he was\n",
      "a Londoner; and Mary had influence enough to persuade him to choose a\n",
      "house at Walworth, where she would be near to her friend Fanny. Then,\n",
      "however, the conditions of her home life caused her to be often on the\n",
      "point of going away to earn a living for herself. In 1778, when she was\n",
      "nineteen, Mary Wollstonecraft did leave home, to take a situation as\n",
      "companion with a rich tradesman's widow at Bath, of whom it was said\n",
      "that none of her companions could stay with her. Mary Wollstonecraft,\n",
      "nevertheless, stayed two years with the difficult widow, and made\n",
      "herself respected. Her mother's failing health then caused Mary to\n",
      "return to her. The father was then living at Enfield, and trying to save\n",
      "the small remainder of his means by not venturing upon any business at\n",
      "all. The mother died after long suffering, wholly dependent on her\n",
      "daughter Mary's constant care. The mother's last words were often quoted\n",
      "by Mary Wollstonecraft in her own last years of distress--\"A little\n",
      "patience, and all will be over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the mother's death, Mary Wollstonecraft left home again, to live\n",
      "with her friend, Fanny Blood, who was at Walham Green. In 1782 she went\n",
      "to nurse a married sister through a dangerous illness. The father's need\n",
      "of support next pressed upon her. He had spent not only his own money,\n",
      "but also the little that had been specially reserved for his children.\n",
      "It is said to be the privilege of a passionate man that he always gets\n",
      "what he wants; he gets to be avoided, and they never find a convenient\n",
      "corner of their own who shut themselves out from the kindly fellowship\n",
      "of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1783 Mary Wollstonecraft--aged twenty-four--with two of her sisters,\n",
      "joined Fanny Blood in setting up a day school at Islington, which was\n",
      "removed in a few months to Newington Green. Early in 1785 Fanny Blood,\n",
      "far gone in consumption, sailed for Lisbon to marry an Irish surgeon who\n",
      "was settled there. After her marriage it was evident that she had but a\n",
      "few months to live; Mary Wollstonecraft, deaf to all opposing counsel,\n",
      "then left her school, and, with help of money from a friendly woman, she\n",
      "went out to nurse her, and was by her when she died. Mary Wollstonecraft\n",
      "remembered her loss ten years afterwards in these \"Letters from Sweden\n",
      "and Norway,\" when she wrote: \"The grave has closed over a dear friend,\n",
      "the friend of my youth; still she is present with me, and I hear her\n",
      "soft voice warbling as I stray over the heath.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Wollstonecraft left Lisbon for England late in December, 1785. When\n",
      "she came back she found Fanny's poor parents anxious to go back to\n",
      "Ireland; and as she had been often told that she could earn by writing,\n",

      "Woman,\" while the air was full of declamation on the \"Rights of Man.\"\n",
      "The claims made in this little book were in advance of the opinion of\n",

      "married man. She felt herself to be too strongly drawn towards him, and\n",
      "she went to Paris at the close of the year 1792, to break the spell. She\n",
      "felt lonely and sad, and was not the happier for being in a mansion lent\n",
      "to her, from which the owner was away, and in which she lived surrounded\n",
      "by his servants. Strong womanly instincts were astir within her, and\n",

      "Four months after she had gone to Paris, Mary Wollstonecraft met at the\n",
      "house of a merchant, with whose wife she had become intimate, an\n",
      "American named Gilbert Imlay. He won her affections. That was in April,\n",
      "1793. He had no means, and she had home embarrassments, for which she\n",
      "was unwilling that he should become in any way responsible. A part of\n",
      "the new dream in some minds then was of a love too pure to need or bear\n",

      "implied, it was said, a distrust of fidelity. When Gilbert Imlay would\n",

      "would keep him legally exempt from her responsibilities towards the\n",
      "father, sisters, brothers, whom she was supporting. She took his name\n",
      "and called herself his wife, when the French Convention, indignant at\n",
      "the conduct of the British Government, issued a decree from the effects\n",
      "of which she would escape as the wife of a citizen of the United States.\n",
      "But she did not marry. She witnessed many of the horrors that came of\n",
      "the loosened passions of an untaught populace. A child was born to\n",
      "her--a girl whom she named after the dead friend of her own girlhood.\n",
      "And then she found that she had leant upon a reed. She was neglected;\n",
      "and was at last forsaken. Having sent her to London, Imlay there visited\n",
      "her, to explain himself away. She resolved on suicide, and in dissuading\n",
      "her from that he gave her hope again. He needed somebody who had good\n",
      "judgment, and who cared for his interests, to represent him in some\n",
      "business affairs in Norway. She undertook to act for him, and set out on\n",
      "the voyage only a week after she had determined to destroy herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest of this book which describes her travel is quickened by a\n",
      "knowledge of the heart-sorrow that underlies it all. Gilbert Imlay had\n",
      "promised to meet her upon her return, and go with her to Switzerland.\n",
      "But the letters she had from him in Sweden and Norway were cold, and she\n",
      "came back to find that she was wholly forsaken for an actress from a\n",
      "strolling company of players. Then she went up the river to drown\n",
      "herself. She paced the road at Putney on an October night, in 1795, in\n",
      "heavy rain, until her clothes were drenched, that she might sink more\n",
      "surely, and then threw herself from the top of Putney Bridge.\n",
      "\n",

      "of the other causes, with which you are already sufficiently acquainted,\n",
      "that it is with some difficulty I adhere to my determination of giving\n",
      "you my observations, as I travel through new scenes, whilst warmed with\n",
      "the impression they have made on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, as I mentioned to you, promised to put me on shore at\n",
      "Arendall or Gothenburg in his way to Elsineur, but contrary winds\n",
      "obliged us to pass both places during the night. In the morning,\n",
      "however, after we had lost sight of the entrance of the latter bay, the\n",
      "vessel was becalmed; and the captain, to oblige me, hanging out a signal\n",
      "for a pilot, bore down towards the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "My attention was particularly directed to the lighthouse, and you can\n",
      "scarcely imagine with what anxiety I watched two long hours for a boat\n",
      "to emancipate me; still no one appeared. Every cloud that flitted on the\n",
      "horizon was hailed as a liberator, till approaching nearer, like most of\n",
      "the prospects sketched by hope, it dissolved under the eye into\n",
      "disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weary of expectation, I then began to converse with the captain on the\n",
      "subject, and from the tenor of the information my questions drew forth I\n",
      "soon concluded that if I waited for a boat I had little chance of\n",
      "getting on shore at this place. Despotism, as is usually the case, I\n",
      "found had here cramped the industry of man. The pilots being paid by\n",
      "the king, and scantily, they will not run into any danger, or even quit\n",
      "their hovels, if they can possibly avoid it, only to fulfil what is\n",
      "termed their duty. How different is it on the English coast, where, in\n",
      "the most stormy weather, boats immediately hail you, brought out by the\n",
      "expectation of extraordinary profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disliking to sail for Elsineur, and still more to lie at anchor or\n",
      "cruise about the coast for several days, I exerted all my rhetoric to\n",
      "prevail on the captain to let me have the ship's boat, and though I\n",
      "added the most forcible of arguments, I for a long time addressed him in\n",
      "vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a kind of rule at sea not to send out a boat. The captain was a\n",
      "good-natured man; but men with common minds seldom break through general\n",
      "rules. Prudence is ever the resort of weakness, and they rarely go as\n",
      "far as they may in any undertaking who are determined not to go beyond\n",
      "it on any account. If, however, I had some trouble with the captain, I\n",
      "did not lose much time with the sailors, for they, all alacrity, hoisted\n",
      "out the boat the moment I obtained permission, and promised to row me to\n",
      "the lighthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not once allow myself to doubt of obtaining a conveyance from\n",

      "The day was fine, and I enjoyed the water till, approaching the little\n",
      "island, poor Marguerite, whose timidity always acts as a feeler before\n",
      "her adventuring spirit, began to wonder at our not seeing any\n",
      "inhabitants. I did not listen to her. But when, on landing, the same\n",
      "silence prevailed, I caught the alarm, which was not lessened by the\n",
      "sight of two old men whom we forced out of their wretched hut. Scarcely\n",
      "human in their appearance, we with difficulty obtained an intelligible\n",
      "reply to our questions, the result of which was that they had no boat,\n",
      "and were not allowed to quit their post on any pretence. But they\n",
      "informed us that there was at the other side, eight or ten miles over, a\n",
      "pilot's dwelling. Two guineas tempted the sailors to risk the captain's\n",
      "displeasure, and once more embark to row me over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather was pleasant, and the appearance of the shore so grand that\n",
      "I should have enjoyed the two hours it took to reach it, but for the\n",
      "fatigue which was too visible in the countenances of the sailors, who,\n",
      "instead of uttering a complaint, were, with the thoughtless hilarity\n",
      "peculiar to them, joking about the possibility of the captain's taking\n",
      "advantage of a slight westerly breeze, which was springing up, to sail\n",
      "without them. Yet, in spite of their good humour, I could not help\n",
      "growing uneasy when the shore, receding, as it were, as we advanced,\n",
      "seemed to promise no end to their toil. This anxiety increased when,\n",
      "turning into the most picturesque bay I ever saw, my eyes sought in vain\n",
      "for the vestige of a human habitation. Before I could determine what\n",
      "step to take in such a dilemma (for I could not bear to think of\n",
      "returning to the ship), the sight of a barge relieved me, and we\n",
      "hastened towards it for information. We were immediately directed to\n",
      "pass some jutting rocks, when we should see a pilot's hut.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a solemn silence in this scene which made itself be felt. The\n",
      "sunbeams that played on the ocean, scarcely ruffled by the lightest\n",
      "breeze, contrasted with the huge dark rocks, that looked like the rude\n",
      "materials of creation forming the barrier of unwrought space, forcibly\n",
      "struck me, but I should not have been sorry if the cottage had not\n",
      "appeared equally tranquil. Approaching a retreat where strangers,\n",
      "especially women, so seldom appeared, I wondered that curiosity did not\n",
      "bring the beings who inhabited it to the windows or door. I did not\n",
      "immediately recollect that men who remain so near the brute creation, as\n",
      "only to exert themselves to find the food necessary to sustain life,\n",
      "have little or no imagination to call forth the curiosity necessary to\n",
      "fructify the faint glimmerings of mind which entitle them to rank as\n",
      "lords of the creation. Had they either they could not contentedly remain\n",
      "rooted in the clods they so indolently cultivate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst the sailors went to seek for the sluggish inhabitants, these\n",
      "conclusions occurred to me; and, recollecting the extreme fondness which\n",
      "the Parisians ever testify for novelty, their very curiosity appeared to\n",
      "me a proof of the progress they had made in refinement. Yes, in the art\n",
      "of living--in the art of escaping from the cares which embarrass the\n",
      "first steps towards the attainment of the pleasures of social life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilots informed the sailors that they were under the direction of a\n",
      "lieutenant retired from the service, who spoke English; adding that they\n",
      "could do nothing without his orders, and even the offer of money could\n",
      "hardly conquer their laziness and prevail on them to accompany us to his\n",
      "dwelling. They would not go with me alone, which I wanted them to have\n",
      "done, because I wished to dismiss the sailors as soon as possible. Once\n",
      "more we rowed off, they following tardily, till, turning round another\n",
      "bold protuberance of the rocks, we saw a boat making towards us, and\n",
      "soon learnt that it was the lieutenant himself, coming with some\n",
      "earnestness to see who we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "To save the sailors any further toil, I had my baggage instantly removed\n",
      "into his boat; for, as he could speak English, a previous parley was not\n",
      "necessary, though Marguerite's respect for me could hardly keep her from\n",
      "expressing the fear, strongly marked on her countenance, which my\n",
      "putting ourselves into the power of a strange man excited. He pointed\n",
      "out his cottage; and, drawing near to it, I was not sorry to see a\n",
      "female figure, though I had not, like Marguerite, been thinking of\n",
      "robberies, murders, or the other evil which instantly, as the sailors\n",
      "would have said, runs foul of a woman's imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering I was still better pleased to find a clean house, with some\n",
      "degree of rural elegance. The beds were of muslin, coarse it is true,\n",
      "but dazzlingly white; and the floor was strewed over with little sprigs\n",
      "of juniper (the custom, as I afterwards found, of the country), which\n",
      "formed a contrast with the curtains, and produced an agreeable sensation\n",
      "of freshness, to soften the ardour of noon. Still nothing was so\n",
      "pleasing as the alacrity of hospitality--all that the house afforded was\n",
      "quickly spread on the whitest linen. Remember, I had just left the\n",
      "vessel, where, without being fastidious, I had continually been\n",
      "disgusted. Fish, milk, butter, and cheese, and, I am sorry to add,\n",
      "brandy, the bane of this country, were spread on the board. After we had\n",
      "dined hospitality made them, with some degree of mystery, bring us some\n",
      "excellent coffee. I did not then know that it was prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good man of the house apologised for coming in continually, but\n",
      "declared that he was so glad to speak English he could not stay out. He\n",
      "need not have apologised; I was equally glad of his company. With the\n",
      "wife I could only exchange smiles, and she was employed observing the\n",
      "make of our clothes. My hands, I found, had first led her to discover\n",
      "that I was the lady. I had, of course, my quantum of reverences; for the\n",
      "politeness of the north seems to partake of the coldness of the climate\n",
      "and the rigidity of its iron-sinewed rocks. Amongst the peasantry there\n",
      "is, however, so much of the simplicity of the golden age in this land of\n",
      "flint--so much overflowing of heart and fellow-feeling, that only\n",
      "benevolence and the honest sympathy of nature diffused smiles over my\n",
      "countenance when they kept me standing, regardless of my fatigue, whilst\n",
      "they dropped courtesy after courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation of this house was beautiful, though chosen for\n",
      "convenience. The master being the officer who commanded all the pilots\n",
      "on the coast, and the person appointed to guard wrecks, it was necessary\n",
      "for him to fix on a spot that would overlook the whole bay. As he had\n",
      "seen some service, he wore, not without a pride I thought becoming, a\n",
      "badge to prove that he had merited well of his country. It was happy, I\n",
      "thought, that he had been paid in honour, for the stipend he received\n",
      "was little more than twelve pounds a year. I do not trouble myself or\n",
      "you with the calculation of Swedish ducats. Thus, my friend, you\n",
      "perceive the necessity of perquisites. This same narrow policy runs\n",

      "climb the rocks to view the country, and see whether the honest tars had\n",
      "regained their ship. With the help of the lieutenant's telescope, I saw\n",
      "the vessel under way with a fair though gentle gale. The sea was calm,\n",
      "playful even as the most shallow stream, and on the vast basin I did not\n",
      "see a dark speck to indicate the boat. My conductors were consequently\n",
      "arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Straying further, my eye was attracted by the sight of some heartsease\n",
      "that peeped through the rocks. I caught at it as a good omen, and going\n",
      "to preserve it in a letter that had not conveyed balm to my heart, a\n",
      "cruel remembrance suffused my eyes; but it passed away like an April\n",
      "shower. If you are deep read in Shakespeare, you will recollect that\n",
      "this was the little western flower tinged by love's dart, which \"maidens\n",

      "than flowers or fancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lieutenant informed me that this was a commodious bay. Of that I\n",
      "could not judge, though I felt its picturesque beauty. Rocks were piled\n",
      "on rocks, forming a suitable bulwark to the ocean. \"Come no further,\"\n",
      "they emphatically said, turning their dark sides to the waves to augment\n",

      "How silent and peaceful was the scene!  I gazed around with rapture, and\n",
      "felt more of that spontaneous pleasure which gives credibility to our\n",
      "expectation of happiness than I had for a long, long time before. I\n",

      "To prolong this enjoyment, I readily assented to the proposal of our\n",
      "host to pay a visit to a family, the master of which spoke English, who\n",

      "willing to put sterility itself out of countenance. No gardens smiled\n",

      "summer appear to me the finest I had ever seen. Sheltered from the north\n",
      "and eastern winds, nothing can exceed the salubrity, the soft freshness\n",
      "of the western gales. In the evening they also die away; the aspen\n",
      "leaves tremble into stillness, and reposing nature seems to be warmed by\n",
      "the moon, which here assumes a genial aspect. And if a light shower has\n",
      "chanced to fall with the sun, the juniper, the underwood of the forest,\n",

      "misery, as well as rapture, is produced by a quick perception of the\n",
      "beautiful and sublime when it is exercised in observing animated nature,\n",
      "when every beauteous feeling and emotion excites responsive sympathy,\n",
      "and the harmonised soul sinks into melancholy or rises to ecstasy, just\n",
      "as the chords are touched, like the Æolian harp agitated by the\n",
      "changing wind. But how dangerous is it to foster these sentiments in\n",
      "such an imperfect state of existence, and how difficult to eradicate\n",
      "them when an affection for mankind, a passion for an individual, is but\n",

      "When a warm heart has received strong impressions, they are not to be\n",

      "without a thrill of delight, recollect views I have seen, which are not\n",
      "to be forgotten, nor looks I have felt in every nerve, which I shall\n",

      "Though the king of Denmark be an absolute monarch, yet the Norwegians\n",
      "appear to enjoy all the blessings of freedom. Norway may be termed a\n",
      "sister kingdom; but the people have no viceroy to lord it over them, and\n",
      "fatten his dependants with the fruit of their labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only two counts in the whole country who have estates, and\n",
      "exact some feudal observances from their tenantry. All the rest of the\n",
      "country is divided into small farms, which belong to the cultivator. It\n",
      "is true some few, appertaining to the Church, are let, but always on a\n",
      "lease for life, generally renewed in favour of the eldest son, who has\n",
      "this advantage as well as a right to a double portion of the property.\n",
      "But the value of the farm is estimated, and after his portion is\n",
      "assigned to him he must be answerable for the residue to the remaining\n",
      "part of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every farmer for ten years is obliged to attend annually about twelve\n",
      "days to learn the military exercise, but it is always at a small\n",
      "distance from his dwelling, and does not lead him into any new habits of\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are about six thousand regulars also in garrison at Christiania\n",
      "and Fredericshall, who are equally reserved, with the militia, for the\n",
      "defence of their own country. So that when the Prince Royal passed into\n",
      "Sweden in 1788, he was obliged to request, not command, them to\n",
      "accompany him on this expedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "These corps are mostly composed of the sons of the cottagers, who being\n",
      "labourers on the farms, are allowed a few acres to cultivate for\n",
      "themselves. These men voluntarily enlist, but it is only for a limited\n",
      "period (six years), at the expiration of which they have the liberty of\n",
      "retiring. The pay is only twopence a day and bread; still, considering\n",
      "the cheapness of the country, it is more than sixpence in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "The distribution of landed property into small farms produces a degree\n",
      "of equality which I have seldom seen elsewhere; and the rich being all\n",
      "merchants, who are obliged to divide their personal fortune amongst\n",
      "their children, the boys always receiving twice as much as the girls,\n",

      "The mayor of each town or district, and the judges in the country,\n",
      "exercise an authority almost patriarchal. They can do much good, but\n",
      "little harm,--as every individual can appeal from their judgment; and as\n",
      "they may always be forced to give a reason for their conduct, it is\n",

      "obliged to submit to any debasing tenure in order to live, or advance\n",
      "themselves in the world, they act with an independent spirit. I never\n",
      "yet have heard of anything like domineering or oppression, excepting\n",
      "such as has arisen from natural causes. The freedom the people enjoy\n",
      "may, perhaps, render them a little litigious, and subject them to the\n",
      "impositions of cunning practitioners of the law; but the authority of\n",
      "office is bounded, and the emoluments of it do not destroy its utility.\n",

      "Near most of the towns are commons, on which the cows of all the\n",
      "inhabitants, indiscriminately, are allowed to graze. The poor, to whom a\n",
      "cow is necessary, are almost supported by it. Besides, to render living\n",
      "more easy, they all go out to fish in their own boats, and fish is their\n",
      "principal food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower class of people in the towns are in general sailors; and the\n",

      "Ireland, is that vessels, trading to the West Indies, are obliged to\n",
      "pass by their own ports, and unload their cargoes at Copenhagen, which\n",
      "they afterwards reship. The duty is indeed inconsiderable, but the\n",
      "navigation being dangerous, they run a double risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an excise on all articles of consumption brought to the towns;\n",
      "but the officers are not strict, and it would be reckoned invidious to\n",

      "The Norwegians appear to me a sensible, shrewd people, with little\n",

      "sciences.\n",

      "Most of the towns are seaports, and seaports are not favourable to\n",
      "improvement. The captains acquire a little superficial knowledge by\n",
      "travelling, which their indefatigable attention to the making of money\n",
      "prevents their digesting; and the fortune that they thus laboriously\n",
      "acquire is spent, as it usually is in towns of this description, in show\n",
      "and good living. They love their country, but have not much public\n",
      "spirit. Their exertions are, generally speaking, only for their\n",
      "families, which, I conceive, will always be the case, till politics,\n",
      "becoming a subject of discussion, enlarges the heart by opening the\n",
      "understanding. The French Revolution will have this effect. They sing,\n",
      "at present, with great glee, many Republican songs, and seem earnestly\n",
      "to wish that the republic may stand; yet they appear very much attached\n",
      "to their Prince Royal, and, as far as rumour can give an idea of a\n",
      "character, he appears to merit their attachment. When I am at\n",

      "dignity to the parade, and interest to the joy his presence inspired. At\n",
      "this town he pardoned a girl condemned to die for murdering an\n",
      "illegitimate child, a crime seldom committed in this country. She is\n",
      "since married, and become the careful mother of a family. This might be\n",
      "given as an instance, that a desperate act is not always a proof of an\n",

      "An officer, mortally wounded at the ill-advised battle of Quistram,\n",
      "desired to speak with the prince; and with his dying breath, earnestly\n",
      "recommended to his care a young woman of Christiania, to whom he was\n",
      "engaged. When the prince returned there, a ball was given by the chief\n",
      "inhabitants: he inquired whether this unfortunate girl was invited, and\n",
      "requested that she might, though of the second class. The girl came; she\n",
      "was pretty; and finding herself among her superiors, bashfully sat down\n",
      "as near the door as possible, nobody taking notice of her. Shortly\n",
      "after, the prince entering, immediately inquired for her, and asked her\n",
      "to dance, to the mortification of the rich dames. After it was over he\n",
      "handed her to the top of the room, and placing himself by her, spoke of\n",
      "the loss she had sustained, with tenderness, promising to provide for\n",
      "anyone she should marry, as the story goes. She is since married, and he\n",
      "has not forgotten his promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little girl, during the same expedition, in Sweden, who informed him\n",
      "that the logs of a bridge were out underneath, was taken by his orders\n",

      "Before I retail other beneficial effects of his journey, it is necessary\n",
      "to inform you that the laws here are mild, and do not punish capitally\n",
      "for any crime but murder, which seldom occurs. Every other offence\n",
      "merely subjects the delinquent to imprisonment and labour in the castle,\n",
      "or rather arsenal at Christiania, and the fortress at Fredericshall. The\n",
      "first and second conviction produces a sentence for a limited number of\n",
      "years--two, three, five, or seven, proportioned to the atrocity of the\n",
      "crime. After the third he is whipped, branded in the forehead, and\n",
      "condemned to perpetual slavery. This is the ordinary course of justice.\n",
      "For some flagrant breaches of trust, or acts of wanton cruelty,\n",
      "criminals have been condemned to slavery for life the first time of\n",
      "conviction, but not frequently. The number of these slaves do not, I am\n",
      "informed, amount to more than a hundred, which is not considerable,\n",
      "compared with the population, upwards of eight hundred thousand. Should\n",
      "I pass through Christiania, on my return to Gothenburg, I shall probably\n",
      "have an opportunity of learning other particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a House of Correction at Christiania for trifling\n",
      "misdemeanours, where the women are confined to labour and imprisonment\n",
      "even for life. The state of the prisoners was represented to the prince,\n",
      "in consequence of which he visited the arsenal and House of Correction.\n",
      "The slaves at the arsenal were loaded with irons of a great weight; he\n",
      "ordered them to be lightened as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people in the House of Correction were commanded not to speak to\n",
      "him; but four women, condemned to remain there for life, got into the\n",
      "passage, and fell at his feet. He granted them a pardon; and inquiring\n",
      "respecting the treatment of the prisoners, he was informed that they\n",
      "were frequently whipped going in, and coming out, and for any fault, at\n",
      "the discretion of the inspectors. This custom he humanely abolished,\n",
      "though some of the principal inhabitants, whose situation in life had\n",
      "raised them above the temptation of stealing, were of opinion that these\n",
      "chastisements were necessary and wholesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, everything seems to announce that the prince really cherishes\n",
      "the laudable ambition of fulfilling the duties of his station. This\n",
      "ambition is cherished and directed by the Count Bernstorff, the Prime\n",
      "Minister of Denmark, who is universally celebrated for his abilities and\n",
      "virtue. The happiness of the people is a substantial eulogium; and, from\n",
      "all I can gather, the inhabitants of Denmark and Norway are the least\n",
      "oppressed people of Europe. The press is free. They translate any of the\n",
      "French publications of the day, deliver their opinion on the subject,\n",
      "and discuss those it leads to with great freedom, and without fearing to\n",
      "displease the Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of religion they are likewise becoming tolerant, at\n",
      "least, and perhaps have advanced a step further in free-thinking. One\n",
      "writer has ventured to deny the divinity of Jesus Christ, and to\n",
      "question the necessity or utility of the Christian system, without being\n",
      "considered universally as a monster, which would have been the case a\n",
      "few years ago. They have translated many German works on education; and\n",
      "though they have not adopted any of their plans, it has become a subject\n",
      "of discussion. There are some grammar and free schools; but, from what I\n",
      "hear, not very good ones. All the children learn to read, write, and\n",
      "cast accounts, for the purposes of common life. They have no university;\n",
      "and nothing that deserves the name of science is taught; nor do\n",
      "individuals, by pursuing any branch of knowledge, excite a degree of\n",
      "curiosity which is the forerunner of improvement. Knowledge is not\n",
      "absolutely necessary to enable a considerable portion of the community\n",
      "to live; and, till it is, I fear it never becomes general.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this country, where minerals abound, there is not one collection;\n",
      "and, in all probability, I venture a conjecture, the want of mechanical\n",
      "and chemical knowledge renders the silver mines unproductive, for the\n",
      "quantity of silver obtained every year is not sufficient to defray the\n",
      "expenses. It has been urged that the employment of such a number of\n",
      "hands is very beneficial. But a positive loss is never to be done away;\n",
      "and the men, thus employed, would naturally find some other means of\n",
      "living, instead of being thus a dead weight on Government, or rather on\n",
      "the community from whom its revenue is drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "About three English miles from Tonsberg there is a salt work, belonging,\n",
      "like all their establishments, to Government, in which they employ above\n",
      "a hundred and fifty men, and maintain nearly five hundred people, who\n",
      "earn their living. The clear profit, an increasing one, amounts to two\n",
      "thousand pounds sterling. And as the eldest son of the inspector, an\n",
      "ingenious young man, has been sent by the Government to travel, and\n",
      "acquire some mathematical and chemical knowledge in Germany, it has a\n",
      "chance of being improved. He is the only person I have met with here who\n",
      "appears to have a scientific turn of mind. I do not mean to assert that\n",
      "I have not met with others who have a spirit of inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The salt-works at St. Ubes are basins in the sand, and the sun produces\n",
      "the evaporation, but here there is no beach. Besides, the heat of summer\n",
      "is so short-lived that it would be idle to contrive machines for such an\n",
      "inconsiderable portion of the year. They therefore always use fires; and\n",
      "the whole establishment appears to be regulated with judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation is well chosen and beautiful. I do not find, from the\n",
      "observation of a person who has resided here for forty years, that the\n",
      "sea advances or recedes on this coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already remarked that little attention is paid to education,\n",
      "excepting reading, writing, and the rudiments of arithmetic; I ought to\n",
      "have added that a catechism is carefully taught, and the children\n",
      "obliged to read in the churches, before the congregation, to prove that\n",
      "they are not neglected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Degrees, to enable any one to practise any profession, must be taken at\n",
      "Copenhagen; and the people of this country, having the good sense to\n",
      "perceive that men who are to live in a community should at least acquire\n",
      "the elements of their knowledge, and form their youthful attachments\n",
      "there, are seriously endeavouring to establish a university in Norway.\n",
      "And Tonsberg, as a central place in the best part of the country, had\n",
      "the most suffrages, for, experiencing the bad effects of a metropolis,\n",
      "they have determined not to have it in or near Christiania. Should such\n",
      "an establishment take place, it will promote inquiry throughout the\n",
      "country, and give a new face to society. Premiums have been offered, and\n",
      "prize questions written, which I am told have merit. The building\n",
      "college-halls, and other appendages of the seat of science, might enable\n",
      "Tonsberg to recover its pristine consequence, for it is one of the most\n",
      "ancient towns of Norway, and once contained nine churches. At present\n",
      "there are only two. One is a very old structure, and has a Gothic\n",
      "respectability about it, which scarcely amounts to grandeur, because, to\n",
      "render a Gothic pile grand, it must have a huge unwieldiness of\n",
      "appearance. The chapel of Windsor may be an exception to this rule; I\n",
      "mean before it was in its present nice, clean state. When I first saw\n",
      "it, the pillars within had acquired, by time, a sombre hue, which\n",
      "accorded with the architecture; and the gloom increased its dimensions\n",
      "to the eye by hiding its parts; but now it all bursts on the view at\n",
      "once, and the sublimity has vanished before the brush and broom; for it\n",
      "has been white-washed and scraped till it has become as bright and neat\n",
      "as the pots and pans in a notable house-wife's kitchen--yes; the very\n",
      "spurs on the recumbent knights were deprived of their venerable rust, to\n",
      "give a striking proof that a love of order in trifles, and taste for\n",
      "proportion and arrangement, are very distinct. The glare of light thus\n",
      "introduced entirely destroys the sentiment these piles are calculated to\n",
      "inspire; so that, when I heard something like a jig from the organ-loft,\n",
      "I thought it an excellent hall for dancing or feasting. The measured\n",
      "pace of thought with which I had entered the cathedral changed into a\n",
      "trip; and I bounded on the terrace, to see the royal family, with a\n",
      "number of ridiculous images in my head that I shall not now recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Norwegians are fond of music, and every little church has an organ.\n",
      "In the church I have mentioned there is an inscription importing that a\n",
      "king James VI. of Scotland and I. of England, who came with more than\n",
      "princely gallantry to escort his bride home--stood there, and heard\n",
      "divine service.\n",

      "There is a little recess full of coffins, which contains bodies embalmed\n",
      "long since--so long, that there is not even a tradition to lead to a\n",
      "guess at their names.\n",
      "\n",
      "A desire of preserving the body seems to have prevailed in most\n",
      "countries of the world, futile as it is to term it a preservation, when\n",
      "the noblest parts are immediately sacrificed merely to save the muscles,\n",
      "skin, and bone from rottenness. When I was shown these human\n",
      "petrifactions, I shrank back with disgust and horror. \"Ashes to ashes!\"\n",
      "thought I--\"Dust to dust!\"  If this be not dissolution, it is something\n",
      "worse than natural decay--it is treason against humanity, thus to lift\n",
      "up the awful veil which would fain hide its weakness. The grandeur of\n",
      "the active principle is never more strongly felt than at such a sight,\n",

      "that, pacing slowly one after the other, along an inviting path in the\n",
      "vale below, were repairing to the cottages to be milked. With what\n",
      "ineffable pleasure have I not gazed--and gazed again, losing my breath\n",
      "through my eyes--my very soul diffused itself in the scene; and, seeming\n",

      "to calm an impetuous tide, labouring to make my feelings take an orderly\n",

      "in Sweden, and after I arrived at Tonsberg. By chance I found a fine\n",
      "rivulet filtered through the rocks, and confined in a basin for the\n",

      "the good effect of the various waters which invalids are sent to drink\n",

      "young woman whom I mentioned to you proposed rowing me across the water\n",
      "amongst the rocks; but as she was pregnant, I insisted on taking one of\n",
      "the oars, and learning to row. It was not difficult, and I do not know a\n",
      "pleasanter exercise. I soon became expert, and my train of thinking kept\n",
      "time, as it were, with the oars, or I suffered the boat to be carried\n",
      "along by the current, indulging a pleasing forgetfulness or fallacious\n",
      "hopes. How fallacious! yet, without hope, what is to sustain life, but\n",

      "one side, then on the other, very gracefully, but when I took one of\n",

      "being ushered into an apartment full of well dressed people, and\n",
      "glancing my eyes round they rested on several very pretty faces. Rosy\n",
      "cheeks, sparkling eyes, and light brown or golden locks; for I never saw\n",
      "so much hair with a yellow cast, and, with their fine complexions, it\n",

      "dollars a year, and pays ten for the nursing of her own child. The\n",

      "happiness, that were painful in the extreme, till I was ready to ask\n",
      "whether this world was not created to exhibit every possible combination\n",
      "of wretchedness. I asked these questions of a heart writhing with\n",

      "yesterday, but with an intention of returning in my way back to Sweden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road to Laurvig is very fine, and the country the best cultivated in\n",
      "Norway. I never before admired the beech tree, and when I met stragglers\n",
      "here they pleased me still less. Long and lank, they would have forced\n",
      "me to allow that the line of beauty requires some curves, if the stately\n",
      "pine, standing near, erect, throwing her vast arms around, had not\n",
      "looked beautiful in opposition to such narrow rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these respects my very reason obliges me to permit my feelings to be\n",
      "my criterion. Whatever excites emotion has charms for me, though I\n",
      "insist that the cultivation of the mind by warming, nay, almost creating\n",
      "the imagination, produces taste and an immense variety of sensations and\n",
      "emotions, partaking of the exquisite pleasure inspired by beauty and\n",
      "sublimity. As I know of no end to them, the word infinite, so often\n",
      "misapplied, might on this occasion be introduced with something like\n",
      "propriety.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have rambled away again. I intended to have remarked to you the\n",
      "effect produced by a grove of towering beech, the airy lightness of\n",
      "their foliage admitting a degree of sunshine, which, giving a\n",
      "transparency to the leaves, exhibited an appearance of freshness and\n",
      "elegance that I had never before remarked. I thought of descriptions of\n",
      "Italian scenery. But these evanescent graces seemed the effect of\n",
      "enchantment; and I imperceptibly breathed softly, lest I should destroy\n",
      "what was real, yet looked so like the creation of fancy. Dryden's fable\n",
      "of the flower and the leaf was not a more poetical reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adieu, however, to fancy, and to all the sentiments which ennoble our\n",
      "nature. I arrived at Laurvig, and found myself in the midst of a group\n",
      "of lawyers of different descriptions. My head turned round, my heart\n",
      "grew sick, as I regarded visages deformed by vice, and listened to\n",
      "accounts of chicanery that was continually embroiling the ignorant.\n",
      "These locusts will probably diminish as the people become more\n",
      "enlightened. In this period of social life the commonalty are always\n",
      "cunningly attentive to their own interest; but their faculties, confined\n",
      "to a few objects, are so narrowed, that they cannot discover it in the\n",
      "general good. The profession of the law renders a set of men still\n",
      "shrewder and more selfish than the rest; and it is these men, whose wits\n",
      "have been sharpened by knavery, who here undermine morality, confounding\n",
      "right and wrong.\n",

      "The Count of Bernstorff, who really appears to me, from all I can\n",
      "gather, to have the good of the people at heart, aware of this, has\n",
      "lately sent to the mayor of each district to name, according to the size\n",
      "of the place, four or six of the best-informed inhabitants, not men of\n",
      "the law, out of which the citizens were to elect two, who are to be\n",
      "termed mediators. Their office is to endeavour to prevent litigious\n",
      "suits, and conciliate differences. And no suit is to be commenced before\n",
      "the parties have discussed the dispute at their weekly meeting. If a\n",

      "By these means ignorant people will be prevented from applying for\n",

      "ears, and live by the spoil they caught up in the scramble. There is\n",
      "some reason to hope that this regulation will diminish their number, and\n",
      "restrain their mischievous activity. But till trials by jury are\n",
      "established, little justice can be expected in Norway. Judges who cannot\n",
      "be bribed are often timid, and afraid of offending bold knaves, lest\n",
      "they should raise a set of hornets about themselves. The fear of censure\n",
      "undermines all energy of character; and, labouring to be prudent, they\n",
      "lose sight of rectitude. Besides, nothing is left to their conscience,\n",

      "There is a considerable iron manufactory at Laurvig for coarse work, and\n",

      "This establishment belongs to the Count of Laurvig. Without a fortune\n",
      "and influence equal to his, such a work could not have been set afloat;\n",
      "personal fortunes are not yet sufficient to support such undertakings.\n",
      "Nevertheless the inhabitants of the town speak of the size of his estate\n",
      "as an evil, because it obstructs commerce. The occupiers of small farms\n",
      "are obliged to bring their wood to the neighbouring seaports to be\n",
      "shipped; but he, wishing to increase the value of his, will not allow it\n",
      "to be thus gradually cut down, which turns the trade into another\n",
      "channel. Added to this, nature is against them, the bay being open and\n",
      "insecure. I could not help smiling when I was informed that in a hard\n",
      "gale a vessel had been wrecked in the main street. When there are such a\n",
      "number of excellent harbours on the coast, it is a pity that accident\n",

      "resided constantly in Denmark, and his son follows his example. They\n",
      "have not been in possession of the estate many years; and their\n",
      "predecessor lived near the town, introducing a degree of profligacy of\n",

      "What little I have seen of the manners of the people does not please me\n",
      "so well as those of Tonsberg. I am forewarned that I shall find them\n",
      "still more cunning and fraudulent as I advance towards the westward, in\n",
      "proportion as traffic takes place of agriculture, for their towns are\n",
      "built on naked rocks, the streets are narrow bridges, and the\n",
      "inhabitants are all seafaring men, or owners of ships, who keep shops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inn I was at in Laurvig this journey was not the same that I was at\n",
      "before. It is a good one--the people civil, and the accommodations\n",
      "decent. They seem to be better provided in Sweden; but in justice I\n",
      "ought to add that they charge more extravagantly. My bill at Tonsberg\n",
      "was also much higher than I had paid in Sweden, and much higher than it\n",
      "ought to have been where provision is so cheap. Indeed, they seem to\n",
      "consider foreigners as strangers whom they shall never see again, and\n",
      "may fairly pluck. And the inhabitants of the western coast, isolated, as\n",
      "it were, regard those of the east almost as strangers. Each town in that\n",
      "quarter seems to be a great family, suspicious of every other, allowing\n",
      "none to cheat them but themselves; and, right or wrong, they support one\n",
      "another in the face of justice.\n",

      "I was informed that we might still advance a mile and a quarter in our\n",

      "wretched path, or a boat, the usual mode of travelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore sent our baggage forward in the boat, and followed rather\n",
      "slowly, for the road was rocky and sandy. We passed, however, through\n",
      "several beech groves, which still delighted me by the freshness of their\n",
      "light green foliage, and the elegance of their assemblage, forming\n",
      "retreats to veil without obscuring the sun.\n",

      "evening fine, I was afraid to trust to the wind--the uncertain wind of\n",

      "Though we were in the open sea, we sailed more amongst the rocks and\n",
      "islands than in my passage from Stromstad; and they often forced very\n",

      "seeds of some pines or firs had been wafted by the winds or waves, and\n",
      "they stood to brave the elements.\n",

      "Several of the islands were inhabited by pilots; and the Norwegian\n",

      "that they were very comfortable dwellings, and that they have not only\n",
      "the necessaries, but even what might be reckoned the superfluities of\n",

      "determined to stop for the night at a little haven, some half dozen\n",

      "produced dreams, where Paradise was before me. My little cherub was\n",
      "again hiding her face in my bosom. I heard her sweet cooing beat on my\n",

      "preserved her Norwegian simplicity. There was, in fact, a graceful\n",
      "timidity in her address, inexpressibly charming. This surprised me a\n",

      "rather dulness. The fire of fancy, which had been kept alive in the\n",

      "such a large portion of mankind. I felt like a bird fluttering on the\n",

      "Christiania is a clean, neat city; but it has none of the graces of\n",
      "architecture, which ought to keep pace with the refining manners of a\n",
      "people--or the outside of the house will disgrace the inside, giving the\n",
      "beholder an idea of overgrown wealth devoid of taste. Large square\n",
      "wooden houses offend the eye, displaying more than Gothic barbarism.\n",
      "Huge Gothic piles, indeed, exhibit a characteristic sublimity, and a\n",
      "wildness of fancy peculiar to the period when they were erected; but\n",
      "size, without grandeur or elegance, has an emphatical stamp of meanness,\n",
      "of poverty of conception, which only a commercial spirit could give.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same thought has struck me, when I have entered the meeting-house of\n",
      "my respected friend, Dr. Price. I am surprised that the dissenters, who\n",
      "have not laid aside all the pomps and vanities of life, should imagine a\n",
      "noble pillar, or arch, unhallowed. Whilst men have senses, whatever\n",
      "soothes them lends wings to devotion; else why do the beauties of\n",
      "nature, where all that charm them are spread around with a lavish hand,\n",
      "force even the sorrowing heart to acknowledge that existence is a\n",
      "blessing? and this acknowledgment is the most sublime homage we can pay\n",
      "to the Deity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument of convenience is absurd. Who would labour for wealth, if\n",
      "it were to procure nothing but conveniences. If we wish to render\n",
      "mankind moral from principle, we must, I am persuaded, give a greater\n",
      "scope to the enjoyments of the senses by blending taste with them. This\n",
      "has frequently occurred to me since I have been in the north, and\n",
      "observed that there sanguine characters always take refuge in\n",
      "drunkenness after the fire of youth is spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have flown from Norway. To go back to the wooden houses; farms\n",
      "constructed with logs, and even little villages, here erected in the\n",
      "same simple manner, have appeared to me very picturesque. In the more\n",
      "remote parts I had been particularly pleased with many cottages situated\n",
      "close to a brook, or bordering on a lake, with the whole farm\n",
      "contiguous. As the family increases, a little more land is cultivated;\n",
      "thus the country is obviously enriched by population. Formerly the\n",
      "farmers might more justly have been termed woodcutters. But now they\n",
      "find it necessary to spare the woods a little, and this change will be\n",
      "universally beneficial; for whilst they lived entirely by selling the\n",
      "trees they felled, they did not pay sufficient attention to husbandry;\n",
      "consequently, advanced very slowly in agricultural knowledge. Necessity\n",
      "will in future more and more spur them on; for the ground, cleared of\n",
      "wood, must be cultivated, or the farm loses its value; there is no\n",
      "waiting for food till another generation of pines be grown to maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of property are very careful of their timber; and, rambling\n",
      "through a forest near Tonsberg, belonging to the Count, I have stopped\n",
      "to admire the appearance of some of the cottages inhabited by a\n",
      "woodman's family--a man employed to cut down the wood necessary for the\n",
      "household and the estate. A little lawn was cleared, on which several\n",
      "lofty trees were left which nature had grouped, whilst the encircling\n",
      "firs sported with wild grace. The dwelling was sheltered by the forest,\n",
      "noble pines spreading their branches over the roof; and before the door\n",
      "a cow, goat, nag, and children, seemed equally content with their lot;\n",
      "and if contentment be all we can attain, it is, perhaps, best secured by\n",
      "ignorance.\n",

      "disappears almost before it has ripened the fruit of autumn--even, as it\n",

      "in enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will ask, perhaps, why I wished to go farther northward. Why? not\n",
      "only because the country, from all I can gather, is most romantic,\n",
      "abounding in forests and lakes, and the air pure, but I have heard much\n",
      "of the intelligence of the inhabitants, substantial farmers, who have\n",
      "none of that cunning to contaminate their simplicity, which displeased\n",
      "me so much in the conduct of the people on the sea coast. A man who has\n",
      "been detected in any dishonest act can no longer live among them. He is\n",
      "universally shunned, and shame becomes the severest punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a contempt have they, in fact, for every species of fraud, that\n",
      "they will not allow the people on the western coast to be their\n",

      "regardless whether I went down or across the stream, and I did not know\n",
      "that I was wet before the hostess marked it. My imagination has never\n",

      "too true. The boisterous merriment that almost every instant produced a\n",
      "quarrel, or made me dread one, with the clouds of tobacco, and fumes of\n",

      "evening was fresh many were stretched on the grass like weary cattle;\n",
      "and drunken men had fallen by the road-side. On a rock, under the shade\n",
      "of lofty trees, a large party of men and women had lighted a fire,\n",
      "cutting down fuel around to keep it alive all night. They were drinking,\n",
      "smoking, and laughing with all their might and main. I felt for the\n",
      "trees whose torn branches strewed the ground. Hapless nymphs! your\n",

      "\n",
      "As there was no remedy I entered, and was almost driven back by the\n",
      "stench--a softer phrase would not have conveyed an idea of the hot\n",
      "vapour that issued from an apartment in which some eight or ten people\n",
      "were sleeping, not to reckon the cats and dogs stretched on the floor.\n",
      "Two or three of the men or women were on the benches, others on old\n",

      "amongst the pots, pans, milk-pails, and washing-tubs. After scaling a\n",
      "ruinous staircase I was shown a bed-chamber. The bed did not invite me\n",

      "The distance from Elsineur to Copenhagen is twenty-two miles; the road\n",
      "is very good, over a flat country diversified with wood, mostly beech,\n",
      "and decent mansions. There appeared to be a great quantity of corn land,\n",
      "and the soil looked much more fertile than it is in general so near the\n",
      "sea. The rising grounds, indeed, were very few, and around Copenhagen it\n",
      "is a perfect plain; of course has nothing to recommend it but\n",
      "cultivation, not decorations. If I say that the houses did not disgust\n",
      "me, I tell you all I remember of them, for I cannot recollect any\n",
      "pleasurable sensations they excited, or that any object, produced by\n",
      "nature or art, took me out of myself. The view of the city, as we drew\n",
      "near, was rather grand, but without any striking feature to interest the\n",
      "imagination, excepting the trees which shade the footpaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before I reached Copenhagen I saw a number of tents on a wide\n",
      "plain, and supposed that the rage for encampments had reached this city;\n",

      "families who had been driven out of their habitations by the late fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering soon after, I passed amongst the dust and rubbish it had left,\n",
      "affrighted by viewing the extent of the devastation, for at least a\n",
      "quarter of the city had been destroyed. There was little in the\n",
      "appearance of fallen bricks and stacks of chimneys to allure the\n",
      "imagination into soothing melancholy reveries; nothing to attract the\n",
      "eye of taste, but much to afflict the benevolent heart. The depredations\n",
      "of time have always something in them to employ the fancy, or lead to\n",
      "musing on subjects which, withdrawing the mind from objects of sense,\n",
      "seem to give it new dignity; but here I was treading on live ashes. The\n",
      "sufferers were still under the pressure of the misery occasioned by this\n",

      "my mind when sympathy rises to anguish. I therefore desired the driver\n",

      "utmost that can, or could ever, I believe, have been said in its praise,\n",
      "might be comprised in a few words. The streets are open, and many of the\n",

      "till they could find some other abode. Beds were thrown on the landing-\n",

      "calamity will be more severely felt, I fear, though the exertions on the\n",
      "part of Government are very considerable. Private charity has also, no\n",
      "doubt, done much to alleviate the misery which obtrudes itself at every\n",

      "existed, the conflagration might have been smothered in the beginning,\n",

      "only for endeavouring to render the public amusements more elegant, but\n",
      "for her very charities, because she erected, amongst other institutions,\n",
      "a hospital to receive foundlings. Disgusted with many customs which pass\n",

      "I arrived at Corsoer the night after I quitted Copenhagen, purposing to\n",
      "take my passage across the Great Belt the next morning, though the\n",
      "weather was rather boisterous. It is about four-and-twenty miles but as\n",
      "both I and my little girl are never attacked by sea-sickness--though who\n",
      "can avoid _ennui_?--I enter a boat with the same indifference as I\n",
      "change horses; and as for danger, come when it may, I dread it not\n",
      "sufficiently to have any anticipating fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The road from Copenhagen was very good, through an open, flat country\n",
      "that had little to recommend it to notice excepting the cultivation,\n",
      "which gratified my heart more than my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a barge with a German baron who was hastening back from a tour\n",
      "into Denmark, alarmed by the intelligence of the French having passed\n",
      "the Rhine. His conversation beguiled the time, and gave a sort of\n",
      "stimulus to my spirits, which had been growing more and more languid\n",
      "ever since my return to Gothenburg; you know why. I had often\n",
      "endeavoured to rouse myself to observation by reflecting that I was\n",
      "passing through scenes which I should probably never see again, and\n",
      "consequently ought not to omit observing. Still I fell into reveries,\n",
      "thinking, by way of excuse, that enlargement of mind and refined\n",
      "feelings are of little use but to barb the arrows of sorrow which waylay\n",
      "us everywhere, eluding the sagacity of wisdom and rendering principles\n",
      "unavailing, if considered as a breastwork to secure our own hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though we had not a direct wind, we were not detained more than three\n",
      "hours and a half on the water, just long enough to give us an appetite\n",
      "for our dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We travelled the remainder of the day and the following night in company\n",
      "with the same party, the German gentleman whom I have mentioned, his\n",
      "friend, and servant. The meetings at the post-houses were pleasant to\n",
      "me, who usually heard nothing but strange tongues around me. Marguerite\n",
      "and the child often fell asleep, and when they were awake I might still\n",
      "reckon myself alone, as our train of thoughts had nothing in common.\n",
      "Marguerite, it is true, was much amused by the costume of the women,\n",
      "particularly by the pannier which adorned both their heads and tails,\n",
      "and with great glee recounted to me the stories she had treasured up for\n",
      "her family when once more within the barriers of dear Paris, not\n",
      "forgetting, with that arch, agreeable vanity peculiar to the French,\n",
      "which they exhibit whilst half ridiculing it, to remind me of the\n",
      "importance she should assume when she informed her friends of all her\n",
      "journeys by sea and land, showing the pieces of money she had collected,\n",
      "and stammering out a few foreign phrases, which she repeated in a true\n",
      "Parisian accent. Happy thoughtlessness! ay, and enviable harmless\n",
      "vanity, which thus produced a _gaité du cœur_ worth all my philosophy!\n",
      "\n",
      "The man I had hired at Copenhagen advised me to go round about twenty\n",
      "miles to avoid passing the Little Belt excepting by a ferry, as the wind\n",
      "was contrary. But the gentlemen overruled his arguments, which we were\n",
      "all very sorry for afterwards, when we found ourselves becalmed on the\n",
      "Little Belt ten hours, tacking about without ceasing, to gain the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "An oversight likewise made the passage appear much more tedious, nay,\n",
      "almost insupportable. When I went on board at the Great Belt, I had\n",
      "provided refreshments in case of detention, which remaining untouched I\n",
      "thought not then any such precaution necessary for the second passage,\n",
      "misled by the epithet of \"little,\" though I have since been informed\n",
      "that it is frequently the longest. This mistake occasioned much\n",
      "vexation; for the child, at last, began to cry so bitterly for bread,\n",
      "that fancy conjured up before me the wretched Ugolino, with his famished\n",
      "children; and I, literally speaking, enveloped myself in sympathetic\n",
      "horrors, augmented by every tear my babe shed, from which I could not\n",
      "escape till we landed, and a luncheon of bread and basin of milk routed\n",
      "the spectres of fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then supped with my companions, with whom I was soon after to part for\n",
      "ever--always a most melancholy death-like idea--a sort of separation of\n",
      "soul; for all the regret which follows those from whom fate separates us\n",
      "seems to be something torn from ourselves. These were strangers I\n",
      "remember; yet when there is any originality in a countenance, it takes\n",
      "its place in our memory, and we are sorry to lose an acquaintance the\n",
      "moment he begins to interest us, though picked up on the highway. There\n",
      "was, in fact, a degree of intelligence, and still more sensibility, in\n",
      "the features and conversation of one of the gentlemen, that made me\n",
      "regret the loss of his society during the rest of the journey; for he\n",
      "was compelled to travel post, by his desire to reach his estate before\n",
      "the arrival of the French.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a comfortable inn, as were several others I stopped at; but the\n",
      "heavy sandy roads were very fatiguing, after the fine ones we had lately\n",
      "skimmed over both in Sweden and Denmark. The country resembled the most\n",
      "open part of England--laid out for corn rather than grazing. It was\n",
      "pleasant, yet there was little in the prospects to awaken curiosity, by\n",
      "displaying the peculiar characteristics of a new country, which had so\n",
      "frequently stole me from myself in Norway. We often passed over large\n",
      "unenclosed tracts, not graced with trees, or at least very sparingly\n",
      "enlivened by them, and the half-formed roads seemed to demand the\n",
      "landmarks, set up in the waste, to prevent the traveller from straying\n",
      "far out of his way, and plodding through the wearisome sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heaths were dreary, and had none of the wild charms of those of\n",
      "Sweden and Norway to cheat time; neither the terrific rocks, nor smiling\n",
      "herbage grateful to the sight and scented from afar, made us forget\n",
      "their length. Still the country appeared much more populous, and the\n",
      "towns, if not the farmhouses, were superior to those of Norway. I even\n",
      "thought that the inhabitants of the former had more intelligence--at\n",
      "least, I am sure they had more vivacity in their countenances than I had\n",
      "seen during my northern tour: their senses seemed awake to business and\n",
      "pleasure. I was therefore gratified by hearing once more the busy hum of\n",
      "industrious men in the day, and the exhilarating sounds of joy in the\n",
      "evening; for, as the weather was still fine, the women and children were\n",
      "amusing themselves at their doors, or walking under the trees, which in\n",
      "many places were planted in the streets; and as most of the towns of any\n",
      "note were situated on little bays or branches of the Baltic, their\n",
      "appearance as we approached was often very picturesque, and, when we\n",
      "entered, displayed the comfort and cleanliness of easy, if not the\n",
      "elegance of opulent, circumstances. But the cheerfulness of the people\n",
      "in the streets was particularly grateful to me, after having been\n",
      "depressed by the deathlike silence of those of Denmark, where every\n",
      "house made me think of a tomb. The dress of the peasantry is suited to\n",
      "the climate; in short, none of that poverty and dirt appeared, at the\n",
      "sight of which the heart sickens.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I only stopped to change horses, take refreshment, and sleep, I had\n",
      "not an opportunity of knowing more of the country than conclusions which\n",
      "the information gathered by my eyes enabled me to draw, and that was\n",
      "sufficient to convince me that I should much rather have lived in some\n",
      "of the towns I now pass through than in any I had seen in Sweden or\n",
      "Denmark. The people struck me as having arrived at that period when the\n",
      "faculties will unfold themselves; in short; they look alive to\n",
      "improvement, neither congealed by indolence, nor bent down by\n",
      "wretchedness to servility.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the previous impression--I scarcely can trace whence I received\n",
      "it--I was agreeably surprised to perceive such an appearance of comfort\n",
      "in this part of Germany. I had formed a conception of the tyranny of the\n",
      "petty potentates that had thrown a gloomy veil over the face of the\n",
      "whole country in my imagination, that cleared away like the darkness of\n",
      "night before the sun as I saw the reality. I should probably have\n",
      "discovered much lurking misery, the consequence of ignorant oppression,\n",
      "no doubt, had I had time to inquire into particulars; but it did not\n",
      "stalk abroad and infect the surface over which my eye glanced. Yes, I am\n",
      "persuaded that a considerable degree of general knowledge pervades this\n",
      "country, for it is only from the exercise of the mind that the body\n",
      "acquires the activity from which I drew these inferences. Indeed, the\n",
      "King of Denmark's German dominions--Holstein--appeared to me far\n",
      "superior to any other part of his kingdom which had fallen under my\n",
      "view; and the robust rustics to have their muscles braced, instead of\n",
      "the, as it were, lounge of the Danish peasantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arriving at Sleswick, the residence of Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel,\n",
      "the sight of the soldiers recalled all the unpleasing ideas of German\n",
      "despotism, which imperceptibly vanished as I advanced into the country.\n",
      "I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horror, these beings training to be\n",
      "sold to slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell into reflections on an\n",
      "old opinion of mine, that it is the preservation of the species, not of\n",
      "individuals, which appears to be the design of the Deity throughout the\n",
      "whole of Nature. Blossoms come forth only to be blighted; fish lay their\n",
      "spawn where it will be devoured; and what a large portion of the human\n",
      "race are born merely to be swept prematurely away!  Does not this waste\n",
      "of budding life emphatically assert that it is not men, but Man, whose\n",
      "preservation is so necessary to the completion of the grand plan of the\n",
      "universe?  Children peep into existence, suffer, and die; men play like\n",
      "moths about a candle, and sink into the flame; war, and \"the thousand\n",
      "ills which flesh is heir to,\" mow them down in shoals; whilst the more\n",
      "cruel prejudices of society palsy existence, introducing not less sure\n",
      "though slower decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The castle was heavy and gloomy, yet the grounds about it were laid out\n",
      "with some taste; a walk, winding under the shade of lofty trees, led to\n",
      "a regularly built and animated town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I crossed the drawbridge, and entered to see this shell of a court in\n",
      "miniature, mounting ponderous stairs--it would be a solecism to say a\n",
      "flight--up which a regiment of men might have marched, shouldering their\n",
      "firelocks to exercise in vast galleries, where all the generations of\n",
      "the Princes of Hesse-Cassel might have been mustered rank and file,\n",
      "though not the phantoms of all the wretched they had bartered to support\n",
      "their state, unless these airy substances could shrink and expand, like\n",
      "Milton's devils, to suit the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of the presence-chamber, and of the canopy to shade the\n",
      "fauteuil which aped a throne, made me smile. All the world is a stage,\n",
      "thought I; and few are there in it who do not play the part they have\n",
      "learnt by rote; and those who do not, seem marks set up to be pelted at\n",
      "by fortune, or rather as sign-posts which point out the road to others,\n",
      "whilst forced to stand still themselves amidst the mud and dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting for our horses, we were amused by observing the dress of the\n",
      "women, which was very grotesque and unwieldy. The false notion of beauty\n",
      "which prevails here as well as in Denmark, I should think very\n",
      "inconvenient in summer, as it consists in giving a rotundity to a\n",
      "certain part of the body, not the most slim, when Nature has done her\n",
      "part. This Dutch prejudice often leads them to toil under the weight of\n",
      "some ten or a dozen petticoats, which, with an enormous basket,\n",
      "literally speaking, as a bonnet, or a straw hat of dimensions equally\n",
      "gigantic, almost completely conceal the human form as well as face\n",
      "divine, often worth showing; still they looked clean, and tripped along,\n",
      "as it were, before the wind, with a weight of tackle that I could\n",
      "scarcely have lifted. Many of the country girls I met appeared to me\n",
      "pretty--that is, to have fine complexions, sparkling eyes, and a kind of\n",
      "arch, hoyden playfulness which distinguishes the village coquette. The\n",
      "swains, in their Sunday trim, attended some of these fair ones in a more\n",
      "slouching pace, though their dress was not so cumbersome. The women seem\n",
      "to take the lead in polishing the manners everywhere, this being the\n",
      "only way to better their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I have seen throughout my journey, I do not think the\n",
      "situation of the poor in England is much, if at all, superior to that of\n",
      "the same class in different parts of the world; and in Ireland I am sure\n",
      "it is much inferior. I allude to the former state of England; for at\n",
      "present the accumulation of national wealth only increases the cares of\n",
      "the poor, and hardens the hearts of the rich, in spite of the highly\n",
      "extolled rage for almsgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know that I have always been an enemy to what is termed charity,\n",
      "because timid bigots, endeavouring thus to cover their sins, do violence\n",
      "to justice, till, acting the demigod, they forget that they are men. And\n",
      "there are others who do not even think of laying up a treasure in\n",
      "heaven, whose benevolence is merely tyranny in disguise; they assist the\n",
      "most worthless, because the most servile, and term them helpless only in\n",
      "proportion to their fawning.\n",
      "\n",
      "After leaving Sleswick, we passed through several pretty towns; Itzchol\n",
      "particularly pleased me; and the country, still wearing the same aspect,\n",
      "was improved by the appearance of more trees and enclosures. But what\n",
      "gratified me most was the population. I was weary of travelling four or\n",
      "five hours, never meeting a carriage, and scarcely a peasant; and then\n",
      "to stop at such wretched huts as I had seen in Sweden was surely\n",
      "sufficient to chill any heart awake to sympathy, and throw a gloom over\n",
      "my favourite subject of contemplation, the future improvement of the\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmhouses, likewise, with the huge stables, into which we drove\n",
      "whilst the horses were putting to or baiting, were very clean and\n",
      "commodious. The rooms, with a door into this hall-like stable and\n",
      "storehouse in one, were decent; and there was a compactness in the\n",
      "appearance of the whole family lying thus snugly together under the same\n",
      "roof that carried my fancy back to the primitive times, which probably\n",
      "never existed with such a golden lustre as the animated imagination\n",
      "lends when only able to seize the prominent features.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one of them, a pretty young woman, with languishing eyes of celestial\n",
      "blue, conducted us into a very neat parlour, and observing how loosely\n",
      "and lightly my little girl was clad, began to pity her in the sweetest\n",
      "accents, regardless of the rosy down of health on her cheeks. This same\n",
      "damsel was dressed--it was Sunday--with taste and even coquetry, in a\n",
      "cotton jacket, ornamented with knots of blue ribbon, fancifully disposed\n",
      "to give life to her fine complexion. I loitered a little to admire her,\n",
      "for every gesture was graceful; and, amidst the other villagers, she\n",
      "looked like a garden lily suddenly rearing its head amongst grain and\n",
      "corn-flowers. As the house was small, I gave her a piece of money rather\n",
      "larger than it was my custom to give to the female waiters--for I could\n",
      "not prevail on her to sit down--which she received with a smile; yet\n",
      "took care to give it, in my presence, to a girl who had brought the\n",
      "child a slice of bread; by which I perceived that she was the mistress\n",
      "or daughter of the house, and without doubt the belle of the village.\n",
      "There was, in short, an appearance of cheerful industry, and of that\n",
      "degree of comfort which shut out misery, in all the little hamlets as I\n",
      "approached Hamburg, which agreeably surprised me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short jackets which the women wear here, as well as in France, are\n",
      "not only more becoming to the person, but much better calculated for\n",
      "women who have rustic or household employments than the long gowns worn\n",
      "in England, dangling in the dirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the inns on the road were better than I expected, though the\n",
      "softness of the beds still harassed me, and prevented my finding the\n",
      "rest I was frequently in want of, to enable me to bear the fatigue of\n",
      "the next day. The charges were moderate, and the people very civil, with\n",
      "a certain honest hilarity and independent spirit in their manner, which\n",
      "almost made me forget that they were innkeepers, a set of men--waiters,\n",
      "hostesses, chambermaids, &c., down to the ostler, whose cunning\n",
      "servility in England I think particularly disgusting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of Hamburg at a distance, as well as the fine road shaded\n",
      "with trees, led me to expect to see a much pleasanter city than I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was aware of the difficulty of obtaining lodgings, even at the inns,\n",
      "on account of the concourse of strangers at present resorting to such a\n",
      "centrical situation, and determined to go to Altona the next day to seek\n",
      "for an abode, wanting now only rest. But even for a single night we were\n",
      "sent from house to house, and found at last a vacant room to sleep in,\n",
      "which I should have turned from with disgust had there been a choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I scarcely know anything that produces more disagreeable sensations, I\n",
      "mean to speak of the passing cares, the recollection of which afterwards\n",

An ordered collection is often called a **sequence**. In Python, the most common sequence type is the list. Lists are very useful and very commonly used in Python. We have seen how, when we call the `readlines()` method on a file in Python, the method returns a list of lines, and we saw how we can iterate over those lines.

    "Next we see another code block. This starts with a conditional statement, `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`. This means to run the code only if it is being run as a script, not if it is being imported as a module. We are not at a point where we are writing and importing modules, so any code we run is going to be run as a script. Notice that as written, the code refers to a file called 'gfg.pdf' and 'gfg.txt', which is not what we are using. So, we will have to change these variables before running the code. Otherwise we will get an error, because the Python interpreter will not find the 'gfg.pdf' file. We can also dispense with the conditional."
